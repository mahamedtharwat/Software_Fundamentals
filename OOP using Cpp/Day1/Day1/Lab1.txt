1- Swap Function using pass by value , address , reference

2- class complex and implement print function
   that cover all those cases

r = 3
img = 4   ===> 3+4i

r = 3
img = - 4  ===> 3-4i

r = 0
img =  4  ===> 4i     

r = 0
img = -4  ===> -4i

r = 4
img =  0  ===> 4

r = 0
img =  0  ===> 

3-Sum two complex numbers (member function)
   c3 = c1.sum(c2)

4-Subtract two complex numbers (stand alone)
  c3 = subtract(c1 , c2)

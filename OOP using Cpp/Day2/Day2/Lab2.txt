Task 1: Function Overloading
Objective: Implement function overloading by creating multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists.

Task: Write a program that calculates the area of different shapes using function overloading.

Overload a function named calculateArea to:
Calculate the area of a circle (use one parameter for radius).
Calculate the area of a rectangle (use two parameters for width and height).
Calculate the area of a triangle (use two parameters for base and height).


2- Class date:
	member variables integers(day, month, year)
	constructors(parameterized)
	setters & getters
	member functions: "subtractDate, PrintDate"


Note: signature of "subtractDate" function should be like:
	
	int subtractDate(Date d); //D1.subtractDate(D2)

21/7/2019
(difference between two dates converted to days)

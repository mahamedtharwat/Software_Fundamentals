Task 1: Association
Objective: Implement a basic association between two classes in C++.

Description:

Create two classes: Author and Book.
An Author can write multiple Books.
Implement methods to:
Add a book to an author's collection.
Display all books written by an author.
The association should be unidirectional, meaning the Author class will have a reference to the Book class,
 but the Book class does not need to know about the Author class.





Task 2: Aggregation
Objective: Implement aggregation between two classes.

Description:

Create two classes: Library and Book.
A Library contains multiple Books.
Implement a method in the Library class that allows adding books to the library.
Ensure that the Book objects can exist independently of the Library.


Task 3: Composition
Objective: Implement composition between two classes.

Description:

Create two classes: Car and Engine.
A Car contains exactly one Engine.
The Engine should be created and destroyed with the Car.
Implement methods in the Car class to start and stop the engine.
